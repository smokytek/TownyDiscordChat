# TownyDiscordChat 3.2.0

TownyDiscordChat is a Paper/Purpur bridge between Towny Advanced and DiscordSRV. It creates private town and nation resources, provides a town-only two-way chat bridge, keeps linked accounts synchronized, and publishes configurable Towny activity to Discord.

## Compatibility

- Paper/Purpur 1.21+ and 26.*
- Java 21+ for 1.21.x; Java 25 is required by Paper 26.*
- Public Bukkit/Paper APIs only; no NMS or obfuscated server classes

## Requirements

- Town-only Minecraft ↔ Discord chat bridge with linked-account and wrong-town protection.

- Town events for residents joining/leaving, mayor changes, rank changes, jail, outlaw and tax changes.
- NewDay summaries with Taxes, Residents and Outposts buttons.
- Resident lists with ranks and last access, plus paginated outpost names, PlotGroup names and coordinates.
- Global NewDay embeds for bankrupt, ruined or fallen towns, with configurable story variants and NPC residents excluded.

## Languages

English is the default language. Set the following in `plugins/TownyDiscordChat/config.yml`:

```yaml
language: en # en, it, fr, es or pl
```

On first start, the plugin copies the five locale files to `plugins/TownyDiscordChat/locales/`. Missing keys fall back to English. These files can be edited without rebuilding the plugin.

## Installation

1. Install Towny Advanced and DiscordSRV and configure DiscordSRV's Main Guild.
2. Give the Discord bot Manage Roles, Manage Channels, Manage Channel Permissions, View Channels, Send Messages, Embed Links and Read Message History.
3. Put the bot role above the roles created by TownyDiscordChat.
4. Enable Discord's Message Content Intent.
5. Place the jar in `plugins/`, start the server, edit `config.yml`, then run `/tdc sync` as console or an administrator.
